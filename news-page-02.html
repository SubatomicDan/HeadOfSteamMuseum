						<p>Saving a Century is a photographic exhibition celebrating the work of the Victorian Society. The exhibition, on display at Head of Steam 
						Museum from 2nd to 31st July, is curated by leading architectural historian Gavin Stamp, and uses archive photographs and material from 
						throughout the Victorian Society's fifty years of fighting for historic buildings. 'Saving a Century' includes photos from around the
						country and shows examples of the best Victorian and Edwardian buildings and structures that the Society has campaigned to save, and some 
						that have been lost. It demonstrates the Societyâ€™s success in changing public attitudes towards the architecture of the nineteenth century,
						and its continued relevance for the twenty-first century.</p>

						<h3>Robert Robertson diaries</h3>
						<time datetime="2013-06-11">June 11<sup>th</sup>, 2013</time>
					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>The Friends of Darlington Railway Centre and Museum have recently purchased two diaries at auction for the Head of Steam - Darlington Railway Museum. The diaries, written by
						Robert Robinson between 1859 and 1861, reveal details about life in Darlington in the mid 19th Century and about railway projects being undertaken in the region
						at that time. Robert Robinson, an engineer who worked for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, married into the Pease family and later resided at
						Beechwood. He owned an office close to North Road Station and worked on railway projects in North Eastern Railway region.</p>
						<h4>Curator Leona White-Hannant comments:</h4>
						<blockquote><p>"Without the generosity of the Friends of the Museum we would have been unable to acquire these fascinating diaries. The detailed information about day
						to day life in Darlington, including what Robinson was reading and how much he was being charged for his groceries, makes interesting reading. 
						This coupled with the information relating to the railway projects he was assisting with makes this acquisition an invaluable resource for those 
						interested in local and railway history."</p></blockquote>
