						<h3>The Great Train Robbery</h3>
						<time datetime="2013-10-30">October 30<sup>th</sup>, 2013</time>
					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>If you are interested in crime and the railways then make sure you visit the Head of Steam - Darlington Railway Museum to see 
						'The Great Train Robbery' exhibition! The exhibition, which is on loan from The British Postal Museum and Archive, explores the events and
						impact of 'The Great Train Robbery' fifty years on and the subsequent investigations that took place. At around 3am on the 8th of August, 1963,
						&pound;2.6 million was stolen from a Travelling Post Office en route from Glasgow to London. The exhibition uncovers the investigations that followed,
						in particular the key role The Post Office Investigation Department played, in helping police uncover the events of the robbery.</p>
						<p>The exhibition explores the robbery and its impact through previously unseen files and photographs. It will also look at the effects the robbery had
						on the GPO more widely. The exhibition is on display at the Head of Steam Museum from 30th October until the end of December 2013. Normal museum
						entrance fee applies.</p>

						<p>Arising from an exhibition originally commissioned by the NRM 'Locomotion' three local artists under the banner of 'Cluster' present a unique exhibition
						of contemporary art within Head of Steam - Darlington Railway Museum, inspired by the area's railway heritage. 'Track Across Time' features paintings, sculpture,
						film and photography which bridge two events. One is of local and one of national significance viz. the 150th Anniversary of the opening of North 
						Road Locomotive Works, Darlington, in1863 and the 1914 outbreak of the 1st World War. Both, in their different ways, proved momentous to the
						people of Darlington.</p>
						<p>Cluster members Carolyn Corfield, Vera Hynes and Graeme Rowatt have embraced the concept of designing site specific exhibitions to challenge their
						individual skills, their aesthetic interaction with each other and in this case to acknowledge events which impacted to such extent on the
						local community. Displayed amongst the permanent exhibits within North Road Museum their original pieces aim to enhance the visitor experience by 
						delivering an evocative journey through the artist's imagination.</p>

						<p>On Thursday 19th September the NELPG Thursday daytime volunteers marked the 90th birthday of NER Class P3 No 2392 with a birthday cake and a
						toast – of tea of course: no alcohol allowed on site! Currently undergoing its latest 10 year overhaul at Hopetown it is hoped that the locomotive 
						be back operating when we celebrate its centenary in 2023, when we can celebrate in style! The works are open to visitors from 11am to 4pm on the third 
						Saturday of each month, the next Open Day being this Saturday, 21 September. <a href="http://www.nelpg.org.uk/">http://www.nelpg.org.uk/</a></p>
						<p>The famous watercolour painting of the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway by John Dobbin has had a makeover. The watercolour, which was
						painted in 1871, has undergone conservation work by local conservator James Caverhill to ensure that it is in tip-top condition before being placed in 
						its new gilt Victorian-style frame. Leona White-Hannant, Curator at Head of Steam – Darlington Railway Museum, says “Visitors often thought the watercolour 
						was a print because it was in such good condition and because of its modern frame. We decided this important piece of Darlington’s history 
						deserved a new frame that was in-keeping with the age and style of the painting.” The watercolour is on display in the Edward Pease Room
						at Head of Steam Museum.</p>

						<p>A new art exhibition will feature at Head of Steam, Darlington Railway Museum this month, with paintings inspired by artist David Noble’s childhood. The 'Art of Steam' 
						exhibition will be on display at the museum from Saturday 10 August to Sunday 6 October. A member of the Guild of Railway Artists, David’s love of steam engines and
						railways were inspired by his childhood experiences at Mexborough engine shed, where his father was a engine driver. David will be at the museum on Saturday 10 August from 
						11am until 2pm where he will meet visitors and answer questions about his work. His paintings are for sale, and prints will be available from the museum shop. The exhibition
						is included in the entrance fee for the museum.</p>
